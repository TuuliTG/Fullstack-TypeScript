# Patientor frontend
This typescript frontend application was made for Fullstack open Typescript course in the University of Helsinki.

### Getting started
  - To get the app running just install its dependencies with ```npm install``` and run it with ```npm run dev```.
  - The app should work without a backend, but make sure that the request made to ```/api/ping``` made on startup is successful before continuing.
  - Run linter with `npm run lint`
  - To run the frontend with the backend:  
    Go to the backend folder, run there `npm install` and `npm run dev` to make the backend running.
